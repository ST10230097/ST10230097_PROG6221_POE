Changes Made to Part 2

I did what the lecturer said i must do on the feedback he gave me for my part one which was to add a menu 
that will make it easier for users to navigate what they want to do.
I added more fuctionality to the console application, firstly i made it so that a user is able to add unlimited recipes and 
is able to view which ever recipe he wants. I added colors so that the user can destinguish between user input and out put on 
the console. I added new elements to the engredients section allowing a user to enter how many calories are in the 
specific engridient and what food group does the ingredient belong to
